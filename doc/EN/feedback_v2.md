# Feedback for prototype V2.0

| Reference        | Feedback           | How are we addressing?  |

| Mrs. Deepa     | UV-C has the potential to cause cancer. Has her team addressed it? Can she elaborate on that in the Github write up? She says no shields are required | See [FAQ](https://github.com/openCOVIDIndia/Sterilo_portable_sterilizer/blob/master/doc/EN/FAQ.md)|
| Keshav Swarup    | Plastics-not to be used in UVC sterilizer.  |   See [material_research](https://github.com/openCOVIDIndia/Sterilo_portable_sterilizer/blob/master/doc/EN/material_research.md) |
| Dr.Balachandran | Good idea. There is some discussion of UV sterilisation of FFP2 / FFP3 masks throughout the world but still not yet established. Was there any test done on mask pre and post UV radiations? |  To be looked into |
| Dr.Maria | So firstly. This comes across as a machine to decontaminate things that are touched or used on or by the patient. My point of view is any decontamination is good at this point. However, objects that may have body fluids such as thongs, scissors etc would need the main type of  surgical cleaning. IMO. This is good for pulse oximeter,  blood pressure cuff, pens, stethoscope, clipboards...stationery items etc  |  FIXME|
